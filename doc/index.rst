URLObject 2
===========

**URLObject** is a utility class for manipulating URLs. The latest incarnation of
this library builds upon the ideas of its predecessor, but aims for a clearer
API, focusing on proper method names over operator overrides. It's also being
developed from the ground up in a test-driven manner, and has full Sphinx
documentation.
